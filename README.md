# GraphQLProject
This is a minor project I created to learn how to use GraphQL. I have uploaded this project to my repo halfway through creating it. 
In this project I create a GraphQL server which contains a schema of songs and artists which are interactable via a frontend application.
Additionally the stack I will be using in this mini project will consist of MongoDB for the database, React and Apollo for the frontend and
Node.js, Express and GraphQL for the backend, additionally I will be testing the backend GraphQL server with Graphiql.
